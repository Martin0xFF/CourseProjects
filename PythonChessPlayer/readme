This folder contains a basic python chess player which was an exercise in implementing stacks queues and heaps to create branching descision making. 


Interpreting duelChess.py (with chesslib.py in the same folder) will allow you to play chess against the basic player.

chessP.py tests the look-ahead chess player against the basic 'safe only chess player' which never makes moves which will result in a loss of peices.
